# LLD Interview Problems

This project contains various **Low-Level Design (LLD)** interview problems implemented in Java.

## Structure
- Each module represents a separate LLD problem (e.g., TicTacToe, ParkingLot, VendingMachine, etc.)
- Follow SOLID principles and use design patterns wherever applicable.

## Example
You can add new packages under `src/main/java/com/interview/` for each problem.

Example:
```
com/interview/tictactoe/
com/interview/parkinglot/
```
